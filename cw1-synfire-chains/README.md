# Marking Scheme

**Note**: Your work will be marked by others in your class according to the mark scheme below. It's very important to write clear answers and test that your code runs in a fresh environment, as unclear code will result in zero marks. Shortly after you submit your work, you will be asked to mark 3 other projects. 10% of your grade is for completing this assessment.

## Task Breakdown and Marking Criteria

| **Task**               | **Criteria**                              | **Max Marks** | **Guidance**                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **T2B Background noise**| **Correctness**                           | 15            | <br>- Code runs: +2 marks. <br>- Code produces results shown in the notebook: +2 marks. <br>- Similar to the correct figure: +4 marks. <br>- Mean output rate ~correct: +2 marks. <br>- Mean & std dev of potentials correct: +2 marks. <br>- Noise implementation matches the paper: +3 marks. |
| **T3 Stable propagation**| **Correctness**                           | 10            | <br>- Code runs: +2 marks. <br>- Code produces the figure/results in the notebook: +2 marks. <br>- Correct figure: +4 marks. <br>- Correct parameters per the paper: +2 marks.          |
| **T4 Transfer function** | **Correctness**                           | 10            | <br>- Code runs: +2 marks. <br>- Code produces results shown in the notebook: +2 marks. <br>- Figure close to correct: +2 marks. <br>- Reasoning and implementation of alpha/sigma_out: +4 marks. |

| **Marking completed**    | **Automated**                             | 10            | Full marks awarded if you complete all peer marking assigned to you.                                                                                                                   |
